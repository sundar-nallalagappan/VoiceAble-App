# VoiceAble - Empowering people with vision-related challenges

üåü **About VoiceAble**

VoiceAble is an AI-powered accessibility assistant designed to make digital interactions seamless for people with vision-related challenges. While our primary focus is to empower coders, students, and professionals with vision impairments, the tool is designed to support anyone with vision challenges who uses digital devices in school, college, or at work.

Unlike conventional screen readers, which struggle with embedded text, images, flowcharts, or complex documents, VoiceAble bridges that gap using advanced **multimodal AI**. It provides a frictionless, voice-first experience, ensuring accessibility and inclusivity for everyone.

üé¨ Demo

**How it works**
Voiceable is a standalone Windows utility that runs quietly in the system tray. Simply press Ctrl + Alt + V, speak your query, and the app intelligently processes your voice command ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs interpreting visuals, summarizing information, or performing quick tasks.

**Use Case 1 ‚Äî Interpreting Visuals for Accessibility** <br>
Traditional screen readers struggle to describe charts or visual data. In this demo, Voiceable interprets a sales comparison plot, explaining the insights through natural speech for improved accessibility.

<br>
**Use Case 2 ‚Äî Interactive Q&A on Architecture Diagrams** <br>
In this demo, the user asks a question about the input sources shown in an architecture diagram. Voiceable understands the query, retrieves the relevant details, and responds through its Q&A agent, providing clear, contextual insights from the visual.
